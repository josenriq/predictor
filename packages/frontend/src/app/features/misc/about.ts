    <h1>About this game</h1>
    <p
      >Let's celebrate the upcoming World Cup Qatar 2022 with a friendly game of
      predictions!</p
    >
    <p
      >Born as a pet project, turned company, turned back again to pet project,
      this prediction game can be played for free with your friends.</p
    >

    <h2>How to play</h2>

    <p
      >Sign in during the World Cup and fill out the scores of the
      <a class="text-link" routerLink="/">upcoming matches</a>.
      <b>Final score includes extra times, but not penalty shootouts</b>. Make
      your best guest!</p
    >
    <p
      >Matches become unavailable for prediction
      <b>five minutes prior to kick-off</b>, so make sure you enter your
      predictions in time.</p
    >
    <p
      >When the match day is over, come back and check how many
      <b>points</b> you scored. Points you obtain are accumulated throughout the
      tournament. Compare your stats against your friends and the world in the
      <a class="text-link" routerLink="/leaderboards">leaderboards.</a></p
    >

    <h2>Scoring points</h2>

    <p
      >To score points, you have to correctly predict the outcome of the
      matches. If your prediction matches the final score
      <b class="tw-text-green-600">exactly</b> you win
      <b class="tw-text-green-600">three points</b>; if your prediction didn't
      match exactly, but the final outcome of the match (winner, loser, tie) is
      the same as your prediction, you win
      <b class="tw-text-blue-600">one point</b>; otherwise, you don't win any
      points.</p
    >
    <p
      >Points awarded are the same for all group matches. However, matches in
      advanced phases of the tournament award more points:</p
    >
    <ul>
      <li><b>Group stage:</b> 3 pts exact / 1 pt correct</li>
      <li><b>Round of 16:</b> 5 pts exact / 2 pts correct</li>
      <li><b>Quater-finals:</b> 7 pts exact / 3 pts correct</li>
      <li><b>Semi-finals:</b> 9 pts exact / 4 pts correct</li>
      <li><b>Third place:</b> 10 pts exact / 4 pts correct</li>
      <li><b>Final:</b> 11 pts exact / 5 pts correct</li>
    </ul>
